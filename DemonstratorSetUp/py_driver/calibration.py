"""
Script for automatic calibration measurements of the pumps in the demonstrator.

This script calibrates the inflow and outflow pump of each tube for different duty levels. Each combination of
tube-flow-duty is repeated 5 times. It alternates between the tubes to let the outflow solenoid cool down. The limited
range of water levels of approximately 250 mm to 500 mm is used. A lower water level can cause sonar measurement
interference.

Total calibration experiment takes about 2.5 hours. Supervision is needed, as potential communication errors between
demonstrator setup and PC terminate this python script. To continue after communication error, inspect the `data_file`
for last run experiment, and adjust the start `duty_level` in :func:`calibration()`. Make sure that you rename the
already obtained data file, as this script overwrites old data without warning.
